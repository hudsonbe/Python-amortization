# python-amortization

I've always been curious how amortization was calculated. You intend to take a personal loan or already have one either it's a credit card, auto loan or student loan. You'll probably run into it online when you want to visualize how you can better pay your loan by paying more than just the minimum or how long it will take you to pay it off with just the minimum payment.

As a python lover I knew it was possible to create my own calculator. So after some research how found a python library called numpy-funancial. With the help of the documentation I was able to start. It was easy but I managed to make it work. I used a calculator website https://www.investopedia.com/amortization-calculator-5086959 to verify if it really works. 

What Is Amortization?

Amortization is an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of a loan or an intangible asset over a set period of time. Concerning a loan, amortization focuses on spreading out loan payments over time. When applied to an asset, amortization is similar to depreciation.

How to Calculate Amortization of Loans The formula to calculate the monthly principal due on an amortized loan is as follows:

Principal Payment=TMP−(OLB× 12 Months Interest Rate)
where:
TMP=Total monthly payment OLB=Outstanding loan balance

  An amortization calculator offers a convenient way to see the effect of different loan options. By changing the inputs—interest rate, loan term, amount borrowed—you can see what your monthly payment will be, how much of each payment will go toward principal and interest, and what your long-term interest costs will be. This type of calculator works for any loan with fixed monthly payments and a defined end date, whether it’s a student loan, auto loan, or fixed-rate mortgage.

What Is Amortization?

Amortization is an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of a loan or an intangible asset over a set period of time. Concerning a loan, amortization focuses on spreading out loan payments over time. When applied to an asset, amortization is similar to depreciation.

How to Calculate Amortization of Loans The formula to calculate the monthly principal due on an amortized loan is as follows:

Principal Payment=TMP−(OLB×Interest Rate12 Months)
where:
TMP=Total monthly paymentOLB=Outstanding loan balance 

Principal Payment=TMP−(OLB× 12 Months Interest Rate)
where:
TMP=Total monthly payment OLB=Outstanding loan balance
